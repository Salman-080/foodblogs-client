# About my project features and functionality

- I have used to toast alert for successfull register and login for a user. Also if invalid registration or Login an error toast will be shown at the top center of the windows viewport.

- user can see All Blogs data withOut registration or login. But for each blog details route, update page and Add blog page user must has to login first. Because I have set those pages in private route. I have done this functionality.

- User can add any blog to their wishlist page. User can see top 6 newest posts on homepage.

- Users can see comments and send comments below each blog details page. But the owner of the post can't comment anything on his/her own post. I have done this functionalities.

- Users can see top 10 long description includes blog's owner's information and the blog titles on the featured page on a table format
